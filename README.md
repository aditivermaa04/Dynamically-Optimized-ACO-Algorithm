ACO with Dynamic Evaporation Rate – Adaptive Metaheuristic for Optimization
◦ Developed Ant Colony Optimization with iteration-based dynamic evaporation rate
◦ Implemented a pheromone decay rate increasing with iterations to balance exploration and exploitation during optimization
◦ Recorded improved convergence on CEC benchmarks and engineering problems and validated gains
via Wilcoxon tests and convergence plots
◦ Tools: Python, NumPy, Google Colab, CEC Benchmark Suite, Git
